Many organizations embark on digital transformation. Some succeed on their journey toward digital adoption, but few achieve the full metamorphosis promised by the new digital world.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all playbook or universal target for leaders. Every company has its own industry, operations, history, vision, workforce and financial resources.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, experience reveals key high-level prerequisites for any successful digital transformation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="observe-your-environment">Observe Your Environment</h2>
<p>The first step is to learn from peers within your industry—and beyond—to broaden your perspective. This was the theme of a November seminar organized by the World Economic Forum, attended by over twenty top executives.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is front and center on boardroom agendas because it is both complex and critical. Leadership teams debate topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>balancing investments in today’s opportunities versus future bets</li>
<li>winning the war for digital talent</li>
<li>funding digital initiatives</li>
<li>evolving digital programs</li>
</ul>
<p>These discussions boil down to four focal points:</p>
<ul>
<li>where your organization should head (digital strategy)</li>
<li>how that direction aligns with your business (business model)</li>
<li>which capabilities you need to succeed (enablers)</li>
<li>and how you’ll orchestrate change to reach your destination (orchestration)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="digital-strategy">Digital Strategy</h2>
<p>Crafting a digital strategy starts by confronting three core questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where is my industry headed?</li>
<li>What role will my company play in that future?</li>
<li>How do we reach that vision while managing change at every level?</li>
</ol>
<p>You won’t have all the answers up front. Instead, follow a strategic roadmap that delivers immediate business opportunities while steadily advancing toward your digital transformation target.</p>
<p>A robust strategy generates initiatives. Early projects lay the groundwork for future endeavors. Over time, aggregating these efforts will build a digitally rooted enterprise.</p>
<p>For transformation to stick, everyone in the organization—at every level—must be engaged. Leaders must lead by example, sponsoring initiatives with enterprise-wide impact.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="business-model">Business Model</h2>
<p>To execute your strategy, you need clear workstreams. Interviews with leaders driving digital transformation show that the primary goal is always business evolution. From there, related objectives emerge.</p>
<p>True digital transformation delivers real customer value and stronger business outcomes. It’s more than tech for tech’s sake.</p>
<p>These shifts usually manifest as:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhanced customer experiences</li>
<li>digital products and services</li>
<li>new revenue models</li>
<li>operational improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>The value goes beyond one-off enhancements. It injects lasting efficiency and opens new opportunities.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enablers">Enablers</h2>
<p>Building on your business model, identify the enablers that align with your strategy. Any digital transformation—no matter the scale—requires implementing or upgrading:</p>
<ul>
<li>data platforms and analytics: break down data silos and democratize insights</li>
<li>IT systems: add agility and openness</li>
<li>operating model: rethink relationships with customers, employees, partners, suppliers and shareholders</li>
<li>people and culture: from hiring to offboarding, adapt to cultural and human shifts</li>
</ul>
<p>When people think “digital transformation,” they picture new technology. In reality, success hinges more on organizational and cultural change.</p>
<p>Technology often turns out to be easier to manage than human behavior.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges are recruiting digital talent, upskilling existing staff and transforming culture to become more innovative and adaptable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="orchestration">Orchestration</h2>
<p>The prior steps are challenging yet straightforward—they force hard questions about mission and goals.</p>
<p>Putting digital transformation into practice is far more complex. You must select, prioritize and sequence cross-functional initiatives that touch human interactions and environments.</p>
<p>Most digital programs begin with a pilot: a focused test with dedicated funding, top talent and strong executive backing. These proofs of concept often succeed.</p>
<p>But piloting is one thing; scaling change enterprise-wide is another. Major hurdles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>securing ongoing funding</li>
<li>shifting thousands of behaviors</li>
<li>integrating with legacy systems</li>
<li>…and many more obstacles</li>
</ul>
<p>Success factors often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>clear strategic objectives</li>
<li>active executive sponsorship and ambassadorship</li>
<li>open communication at all levels</li>
<li>effective governance and project management</li>
</ul>
<p>The road to digital transformation is neither easy nor cheap. It demands deep shifts and a willingness to challenge established habits.</p>
<p>Yet preparing for the next decade is imperative. Countless storied companies have faded or vanished for failure to adapt in time—Kodak and Nokia are prime examples.</p>
<p>Will you let your company miss the digital shift?</p>
