    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Digital transformation is far from a new concept. In recent years, companies have rapidly adopted technologies—from the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to chatbots, machine learning, and virtual reality. Almost every organization engages in some form of digital transformation, yet few truly reap its benefits.</p>
<p>A Bain &amp; Company analysis found that fewer than 10 percent of global enterprises actually achieve their forecasted results from digital investments. In other words, over 90 percent still struggle to fulfill the promise of a technology-driven business model.</p>
<p>Successful transformation is complex. It hinges on aligning technology with business capabilities, integrating new and legacy systems, and innovating in areas that may be risk-averse.</p>
<p>When you treat digital as a catalyst rather than an end state, you can make smarter decisions about how transformation will enhance customer experience while driving revenue and efficiency gains.</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of companies worldwide now include digitizing their core business strategy. Let’s debunk four common myths around digital transformation.</p>
<h2 id="1-digital-transformation-is-only-about-technology">1. Digital transformation is only about technology</h2>
<p>Technology is critical, but transformation isn’t just a software upgrade or a supply-chain improvement project. True transformation reshapes your business—its purpose, strategy, and ability to thrive amid radically shifting customer, employee, and partner expectations.</p>
<p>Implementing 5G or other emerging tech can illuminate new workflows, but a well-designed, business-focused process that stays aligned with tech trends and boosts efficiency can also weather major disruptions.</p>
<p>Your digital initiatives should move tangible metrics—revenue, profit, cost, customer engagement, retention, or repeat purchases—in a positive direction. Transformation is about positioning your organization to stay competitive in the digital age.</p>
<p>If you’re leading your company’s tech transition, start by grounding yourself in the realities of transformation—rather than chasing hype.</p>
<h2 id="2-transformation-is-a-one-off-isolated-project-requiring-an-all-or-nothing-enterprise-wide-rollout">2. Transformation is a one-off, isolated project requiring an all-or-nothing, enterprise-wide rollout</h2>
<p>One persistent myth is that digital transformation can be treated like a standalone, one-off project. In reality, it must be a cross-enterprise effort with buy-in from stakeholders at every level. A marketing team, for example, will only succeed if it truly understands customer needs and builds digital experiences around those insights.</p>
<p>This myth implies that every department must go fully digital. That’s not accurate: stakeholders across the organization must engage, but not every process must be digitized.</p>
<p>An effective digital strategy begins by assessing the market, your organization, and your goals. That analysis reveals where to invest in digital and how to maximize returns. Some well-functioning manual processes may not warrant full digitization.</p>
<h2 id="3-we-already-have-a-solid-digital-strategy">3. We already have a solid digital strategy</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is a radical overhaul aimed at meeting evolving customer demands. “Radical” means changing everything: customer- and employee-facing systems, business processes, products and services—even your brand.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of companies believe they have a digital strategy, yet only 14 percent possess the technology and skills to execute it. Few organizations implement their digital plans effectively.</p>
<p>Just 25 percent have mapped the customer journey—a critical transformation milestone—and only 42 percent invest in digital channels. Nearly 90 percent of CIOs in the latest survey admit that a digital project has failed, been delayed, or been scaled back.</p>
<p>You don’t need a perfect, organization-wide data overhaul to start transforming. Whether you call it digital transformation or a tech-based enterprise makeover, technology leaders are at the heart of it all.</p>
<h2 id="4-digital-transformation-is-a-separate-add-on-to-your-existing-business-model">4. Digital transformation is a separate “add-on” to your existing business model</h2>
<p>Transformation isn’t about tacking on another tech project alongside your current strategy. Cloud-based services and subscription models can catalyze change—they’re affordable and accessible to companies of all sizes—but true transformation runs deeper.</p>
<p>You must deliberately model your core processes with tools that enable empirical, imaginative simulations. Transformation is ongoing; it requires continual adjustments to sustain success. Enterprise architects play a vital role in guiding this evolution day to day.</p>
<p>Because they bridge strategy and execution, enterprise architects are essential to your digital transformation and overall business strategy.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding these myths will help you see through the hype and appreciate transformation’s real challenges. Dispelling misconceptions and gaining clarity on what’s required are crucial steps toward success.</p>
