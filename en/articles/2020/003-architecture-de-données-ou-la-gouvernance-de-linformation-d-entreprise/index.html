    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Data Architecture is one of the components of Enterprise Architecture. It focuses on the rules for managing and organizing data.</p>
<p>Be careful not to confuse defining data practices with their implementation, which is handled by more technical roles; nor with the Chief Data Officer, a leadership role responsible for all data-related matters across the organization.</p>
<p>The importance of a comprehensive, up-to-date Data Architecture is growing. Data is collected, transformed, stored, and exchanged at an ever-increasing pace.</p>
<p>As a result, data becomes a major and sensitive asset for many entities—businesses, organizations, or public institutions. It’s essential to ensure thorough data cataloging and functional segmentation by application domain, assigning clear ownership, processes, and responsibilities.</p>
<p><img src="/images/web-3967926_1920-1024x594.jpg" alt="A major asset"></p>
<p>Furthermore, regulations for protecting personal data—such as GDPR in Europe (effective May 25, 2018) and CCPA in California (effective January 2020)—introduce new requirements.</p>
<p>In governance terms, Data Architecture establishes the guiding principles for data management as well as the typologies for implementation and usage.</p>
<p>It operates in close collaboration with functional stakeholders, development teams, infrastructure, security, and database specialists.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, the established rules ensure adherence to current regulations and auditability of access to sensitive data.</p>
<p>Regarding data quality, modeling, conversion, and transformation standards—combined with reference data usage—maintain consistency, semantic uniformity, clear asset identification, and assigned accountability.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-data-architecture">Principles of Data Architecture</h2>
<p>Principles introduced by Data Architecture cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geographic location of data: in which country, on which site, with which provider</li>
<li>Physical storage: centralized or distributed (server, storage array, cloud service)</li>
<li>Domain-based segmentation and decoupling of applications: placing data at the heart of functionality and ensuring each application is the authoritative source for its data</li>
<li>Data access and permission management: security is top priority, and daily headlines about breaches underscore the crucial need for robust safeguards</li>
<li>Business continuity processes: backup, replication, offsite storage—global 24/7 operations demand uninterrupted availability, marking the end of the era when applications shut down at 7 p.m. for maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Architecture can be led by a Data Architect or fall under the responsibilities of an Enterprise Architect—or even an Application Architect—depending on the organization’s size and structure.</p>
<p>In summary, treating data as a primary asset and placing customer needs and security at the core drives company-wide awareness of sound data practices.</p>
<p>Moreover, by mastering its information landscape, the organization gains the flexibility and adaptability needed to thrive.</p>
<p>Beyond security, resilience is another critical benefit of Data Architecture, reassuring customers, partners, and market stakeholders.</p>
<p>In contexts of application modernization or digital transformation, comprehensive data mapping, controlled transformation, and systematic cleansing are essential.</p>
