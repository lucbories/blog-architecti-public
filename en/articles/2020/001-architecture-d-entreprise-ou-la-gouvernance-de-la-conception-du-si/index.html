<h2 id="history-of-enterprise-architecture-frameworks-in-brief">History of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks in Brief</h2>
<p>In the early days of computing, organizations needed to map their existing technology. IT architecture was born. In the 1980s and 1990s, the scope of architecture expanded and became formalized.</p>
<p>1986 saw IBM publish the PRISM Enterprise Framework based on its internal research.</p>
<p>In 1987, American consultant John Zachman introduced the Zachman Framework, one of the first formal Enterprise Architecture frameworks.</p>
<p>In 1989, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology released the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model.</p>
<p>By 1994, The Open Group selected the U.S. Department of Defense’s TAFIM as the foundation for TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework).</p>
<p>During the 1990s, frameworks began to integrate application components with overall business strategy, giving rise to FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework) and TOGAF.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="common-principles-of-ea-frameworks">Common Principles of EA Frameworks</h2>
<p>Most Enterprise Architecture frameworks share a layered structure (not to be confused with application layers). In some models, Data and Application are combined into a single layer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Layers_of_the_Enterprise_Architecture.jpg" alt="Les domaines de l’architecture d’entreprise"></p>
<p>These layers represent levels at which processes act on architectural components. Each layer provides services to the one above it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environment: external entities, legal/economic/social constraints, customers</li>
<li>Business: functions that realize the enterprise strategy</li>
<li>Data: business information and any other valuable data</li>
<li>Application: the information system and business applications</li>
<li>Technology: hardware, network and software infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure consistent understanding, architectures are often documented with standard modeling tools such as <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_%28informatique%29">UML</a> or <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview">ArchiMate</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples of Enterprise Architecture diagrams:</p>
<p><img src="/images/EA_reflection_simulation.jpg" alt="Exemples de diagrammes"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="benefits-of-enterprise-architecture">Benefits of Enterprise Architecture</h2>
<p>Enterprise Architecture delivers clear IT strategy execution aligned with business strategy. It improves adaptability—flexibility and agility—and enables efficient management of IS resources. A common framework facilitates communication and simplifies planning by defining clear domains and responsibilities.</p>
<p>EA acts as both binder and catalyst, guiding all parts of the organization in the same direction. It communicates the company’s strategic orientations and enforces shared methods and standards. It also ensures that everyone stays aligned through transparent information sharing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-enterprise-architect">The Role of the Enterprise Architect</h2>
<p>The Enterprise Architect aligns the IS with the organization’s business strategy. Depending on the organization’s size and structure, this role may collaborate with or integrate other architects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business (or Functional) Architect</li>
<li>Data Architect</li>
<li>Application Architect</li>
<li>Technology Architect</li>
<li>Solution Architect</li>
</ul>
<p>The Enterprise Architect’s work is less technical and more strategic and diplomatic. They often bridge gaps between teams that don’t normally collaborate and who start with different reference points.</p>
<p>By leveraging clearly defined and shared data, processes and responsibilities, Enterprise Architecture helps the organization make effective decisions.</p>
