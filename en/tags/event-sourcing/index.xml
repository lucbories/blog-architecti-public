      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) differentiates itself through its ability to propagate state changes as events across distributed systems. This approach relies on producing, transmitting, and consuming events, delivering greater responsiveness and flexibility compared to traditional synchronous request-driven architectures. The rise of microservices, the Internet of Things, and real-time applications has propelled EDA adoption, as these contexts demand asynchronous, loosely coupled communication between components. In this article, we’ll explore EDA’s core principles, key benefits, architectural patterns, concrete use cases, and best practices to guide your implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
